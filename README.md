# Signature as Mail's Attachment
I have developed a simple solution which will get the Pen Input Signature and send that Signature as attached image into the Mail. From this basic logic you can develop and use this functionality as per your Requirements.

# Working Procedure

We have PowerApps Screen, Where we have to insert Signature into the Pen Input control of the PowerApp.

Here is the Email with Signature as Mail.
